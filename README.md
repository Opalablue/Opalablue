### Hi! I'm a illustrator/pixel artist still studying to become a Full Stack developer, but I will be happy to help as I can! ✌️

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my learning path
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on gamedev projects
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with anything programming related
- ⚡ Fun fact: My favorite RPG system is Runarcana (wich is basically D&D but more creative)
