### Hi! I'm a illustrator/pixel artist studying to become a Full Stack developer! Still learning, but will be happy to help as I can! ✌️

- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript
- 🕹️ Looking foward collaborate on gamedev projects!
- 🎨 I can help with design/illustration/mapping related
- 💻 Even if I'm still not experienced I'm willing to share programming knowledge
- 🎲 Fun fact: My favorite RPG system is Runarcana (wich is basically D&D but better)
